QUESTION:::::
connect-network-is-unreachable-on-a-working-connected-wlan0-interface

details:

I finally managed to make wlan0 (an Edimax EW-7811Un USB WiFi dongle) connect to my router, but after an apt-get update I discovered that the Raspberry can't see outside the local network. My Raspberry is running on the latest (as of writing this) Raspbian image.

wlan0 is connected to my router and has been given an IP address
I can ping my router, my printer, and other machines inside the local network, but I can't ping anything in the outside net (also loopback ping on localhost says "host unreachable", but I'd say that it is NAT cancelling 127.0.0.1 requests)
I can successfully connect through eth0, but I need to connect through wlan0.
ifconfig output:

/etc/network/interfaces file:

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

iface wlan0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.9
    netmask 255.255.255.0

    wpa-psk "somePasswordHere"





ANSWER:::::

Problem solved! It seems that even though I added the gateway information into the interfaces file, wlan0 didn't really have a default gateway.

When I ran

sudo route -n
it yielded

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 wlan0
There it is - no Gateway IP. I typed this:

 sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1
(where 192.168.1.1 is an IP address of my router, which is connected to the outside net)
